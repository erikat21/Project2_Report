      <h2>Proposition: There is a discrepancy in accountability for police officers 
        across the 78 NYPD precincts. In other words, the percentage of citizen complaints 
        against officers that actually get substantiated is different from precinct to 
        precinct.

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <img src="images/For_prop.png" alt="This image shows a map of the precincts in 
          New York color coded based on if they have a higher than, lower than, or 
          same substantiation rate as citywide."/>
          <figcaption>A substantial amount of precincts (28%) substantiate at different 
            rates compared to the citywide rate.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We could’ve stuck with a simple bar plot to show the distribution of 
            substantiation rate per each borough; however, by using a choropleth map the 
            reader can visually see how – for the most part – precincts across all the 
            boroughs substantiate at the average citywide rate (grey colored) with the 
            28% of precincts differing scattered throughout NYC.</li>
          <li>We decided to use a narrower confidence interval to highlight the outliers 
            which makes it look like precincts do not behave the same with many precincts 
            substantiating at different rates.</li>
          <li>We decided to use the bar chart on the side as a deceptive technique because 
            the boroughs have unqueal counts of precincts and complaints so the percentage 
            of precincts can't be accurately be compared but it makes readers think 
            substantiation rates are more different from the city average than it is. 
            For example Staten Island only has 4 precincts so the 25%/50%/25% split can 
            be misleading.</li>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Against_prop.png" alt="This image shows a funnel scatter plot 
          showing where precincts lie compared to the expected substatiation rate." />
          <figcaption>Once you consider the number of complaints that each precinct receives 
            compared to the expected percentage of complaints that are substantiated, most 
            precincts seem to substantiate at a similar rate.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We chose a funnel plot because as a simple scatter plot we see an apparent 
            trend in the data; a tapered end trailing off towards the right of the plot 
            with most points being within the expected range near the citywide average. 
            The funnel plot enhances this trend that we want to draw the readers attention 
            to. </li>
          <li>We decided to use a wider confidence interval to limit outliers but framed 
            it as being due to the amount of complaints per precincts making the 
            substantiation rates look like they behave the same.</li>
          <li>We decided to not group by boroughs to show Simpsons Paradox, when grouped 
            it looked like there was a trend of different substantiation rates but when 
            we removed the groups we found there was no such trend</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          In 2020 we saw the repeal of a NYC statute that withheld police officers’ 
          disciplinary records from the public – a decades long fight for justice. 
          Rather than “Why did these NYPD records stay confidential for so long” we 
          turn to the (arguably more) horrifying question of how did these records stay 
          private when there were cases of prolonged abuse of power and neglect of 
          transcribed officer misconducts. The implicit “by-laws” of law enforcement 
          include protecting citizens’ constitutional rights as well accountability of 
          their actions. Regardless of how the NYPD board resolved a civilian complaint 
          – in favor of or denied – oftentimes the public was not informed about whether 
          the accused officer was punished or not; one of the many impediments of the 
          50-a statute. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We focused our proposition on the rate of substantiation across precincts 
          grouped by the 5 boroughs; in which the percentage of citizen complaints against 
          officers that actually get substantiated is different from precinct to precinct. 
          Substantiated, in this case, means that a complaint was found with adequate 
          evidence and thus able to confirm that the alleged incident happened. We consider 
          this biased assumption: will boroughs like the Bronx – low income with a high 
          minority demographic – have a higher percentage of precincts that have lower than 
          the citywide substantiation rate. We believe this assumption to hold value 
          because ethnic minorities have less political and economic power; possibly being 
          a factor in a case having enough evidence and sustenance to deem legitimate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In our For Proposition we purposely created a tighter, more narrow confidence 
          interval (90%) which allows for less variation and a smaller margin of error, 
          and thus were able to prove the original proposition. From a statistical 
          standpoint a more narrow confidence interval conveys that we have a more precise 
          estimation. So, we have “proven” our proposition but have found that our 
          preliminary assumption does not hold. We actually see Staten Island – a high 
          income, primarily white demographic – with the highest percentage of “higher than 
          citywide” and “lower than citywide” substantiation rate. We found this tricky and 
          confusing to explain. With a limited knowledge of the legal and political systems 
          one hypothesis we formulated is the difference in the type of crime and their 
          commonality in differing socioeconomic regions. Blue collar crime is found at 
          higher rates in lower socioeconomic communities – it encompasses violent, drug, 
          and theft crimes – generally small scale offenses for immediate satisfaction. 
          While white collar crime is more common in a higher socioeconomic strata and 
          covers a wide variety of fraud – usually financially centered. This leads to a 
          path of expanding question like: is it more difficult to convince that an 
          officer’s actions were of unnecessary force when the complainant was convicted 
          of a violent offense themselves – excess force needed to restrain a violent 
          situation – or could it be the inverse affect where officers will respond with 
          excess violence to this complainant, consequently providing physical evidence 
          towards the complainant’s case. We are able to address our proposition from two 
          standpoints in this project but are forced to reassess our speculations of what 
          we anticipated and what was unforeseen to us.
